# Cellular-Coverage-analysis-for-sectored-Basestation
This project will explore the effects of downtilting antennas on cell performance, both from a coverage and an interference/throughput point of view. You are to implement a Python application which will simulate the downlink behavior of two basestations along a road communicating with mobiles travelling the road. The basestations can be considered to be 3 sectored basestations but you will only model one sector of each, and that sector will point down the road toward the other basestation (as is common for basestations along busy roads).
